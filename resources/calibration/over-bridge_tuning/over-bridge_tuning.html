<h1>Ironing Cattern Calibration</h1>
<p><strong>You need to do the filament flow calibration and the bridge flow ratio before this one.</strong> It's better if you have done the filament temperature.</p>
<p>This test will print test samples with various level of over-bridge flow ratio, between 100 and 125. Choose the lowest value where the top surface is smooth without rough "holes".</p>

Here, we can see that artifacts exist until the over-brodge flow was set to 115. It was flat from the flow calibration, if it's not now, it's because the bridges below the top surfaces are dropping a bit, and so there are more volume to fill afterwards. Here, 115 should be enough, but 120 is a more safe bet.

<p>This test set the setting "complete individual objects" to true, so you may want to reset your print settings afterwards</p>
